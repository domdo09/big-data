## Project Description
Natural Language Processing & Sentiment Analysis : the aim is to define algorithm for evaluating user’s reviews (positive or negative) or for analyzing user’s sentiment about a given business object.

The proposed approach will be evaluated comparing the obtained result with review stars.
